                <h2 class="para">In 'The Web's Grain', Chimero uses Bachelard's quote to explain what the tech industry has become, adding an immense weight to the world and highlighting the inequalities. However, this quote made me <em>reflect on this culture of creative pursuits becoming monetized activities through societal pressure.</em> Nowadays, it seems if someone takes up a hobby or is a talented creative, they "need" to turn it into a business they can profit from, and I think this can take away from the happiness that the outlet had for the person in the first place.</h2>
