                <h1>Practice Awareness</h1>
                <h2 class="para">The content on this website brought to mind my experiences in typography class, where I learned about the shift in information gathering from traditional books and prints to web and mobile apps. It's fascinating to observe that even print designers are increasingly leaning towards editing with HTML/CSS technology, moving away from design software such as Adobe Indesign. As indicated by the notion that websites age and eventually fade away, it raises a compelling question: <em>what could be the next source to replace websites and apps?</em> The evolution of technology continues to shape how we access information, and pondering the future of digital mediums is both intriguing and essential in our rapidly changing landscape.</h2>
