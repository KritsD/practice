                <h1>Practice Ambiguity</h1>
                <h2 class="para">Along with studying past phenomena, there is an element of randomness that must be taken into consideration when attempting to predict an outcome. We can try our best to carry out analyses and to calculate odds, but <em>there is always room for surprises.</em>
                Personal experiences and desires for the future can influence what we believe to be logical predictions. In the same vein, what you might feel is personal, is more universal than you may think.
