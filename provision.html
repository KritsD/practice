                <h2 class="para">The author emphasizes the concept of building edgeless compositions from separate pieces by drawing comparisons between responsive web design and the work of artist David Hockney. They claim that the rapid growth and mobility of technology might lead to a loss of control and dependence, implying <em>the need for thoughtful decisions and a reevaluation of technology's role in our lives.</em>

                In conclusion, the article addresses themes of dissatisfaction with the technology industry, the importance of mindfulness and simplicity in design, and the consequences of technology's unregulated expansion.</h2>
