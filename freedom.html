                <h2 class="para">Lena Groeger brings up excellent points about how data collectors and data visualizers affect how we see and interact with the world. Examples such as features in the app Glow that alienates queer people, the brown skin tone on Slack, and anti-discriminatory measures taken by Nextdoor illustrate how design CAN either make a product exclusionary or inclusive.
                This text inspired me to question the sources of data in the books I'm reading and the data I use for design projects. It made me <em>question what is normal and whether there is any 'normal' or 'default' user at all.</em></h2>
