                <h2 class="para">Design and capitalism. Such a renewed perspective on this topic has shaped my personal journey. Our self-perception significantly influences the work we produce. As designers, the connections we create between individuals, ideas, and objects resonate within society. Viewing oneself merely as an agent of capitalism, and contributing to the exacerbation of disparities and inequality, can unavoidably manifest in one's creations. Reflecting on the impact of our work on segments of society should be a crucial element in every designer's approach. Reflecting upon your work and how that might impact a minor (perhaps major) portion of society should be in every designer's playbook. <em>I still need to come up with a new standard (yet comical?) answer for my field of work. Perhaps, a social-conscious market oriented artist?</em></h2>
