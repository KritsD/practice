                <h2 class="para">Transparency was a key theme for me in this weeks readings - both in Lialina's text as well as Freiberg's. The distinction Turkle makes that <em>users more often than not equate transparency in digital products with knowing how to work something as opposed to knowing how something works</em> was insightful. Deliberate use of a user's cultural expectations (swiping a deck of cards/using metaphorical language they are familiar with) will be something I remember alongside the heuristic principles of recognition over recall/matching the system with the real world.</h2>
