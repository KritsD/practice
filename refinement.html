                <h2 class="para">I really like the metaphor thinking building websites are like throwing rocks into the ocean. Maybe because I didn't do a good job updating my own website, it's like a rock sinking into the ocean that I occasionally pick back up to the surface, clean it, add a few brush of paint or knock down the shape a bit, then throw it back to the ocean again and will most likely forget about its existence for a while. And <em>that's the beauty of web - it's there even without I remember it, until the end of the world (or when the server is down).</em></h2>
