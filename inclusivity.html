                <h2 class="para">As we mentioned during class, the idea of bias and assumptions can sometimes permeate our decision making as designers to the extent that we may offend or exclude certain groups of individuals. Shapes, such as dots, to draw representation for individual humans have a long history of used for war logs and sectarian sweep in the past. There are instantces where it is appropriate to draw out the entirety of the human figure to evoke a sense of empathy from viewers but can be ineffective when the singular human figure does not represent one single individual. <em>How can designers be able to design empathetically but also creatively</em> or is this the case where creativity comes last?</h2>
