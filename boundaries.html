                <h2 class="para">Rob's visit was my favorite guest lecture so far. Specially, I liked it when he talked about companies in which users become brand fans, and how that might put higher expectations and pressure on the team.  It raises important questions about how companies can manage and nurture this relationship, ensuring that <em>the pressure of high expectations is channeled into positive outcomes and sustainable company growth, rather than leading to burnout or a compromised company culture.</em></h2>
