                <h1>Practice Resourcefulness</h1>
                <h2 class="para">The "fake it till you make it" approach is truly universal. <em>When deadlines are coming up, you've got to be resourceful and find those temporary fixes.</em>Especially in this scenario where showing instead of telling would've made a much greater impact, and it did. Thinking about how Apple tackled challenges during the iPhone's creation is pretty fascinating. They were essentially pioneers, facing problems head-on without the convenience of searching for solutions online. It was all about trial and error, which is basically the essence of innovation most of the time. What's really interesting is how Apple created a culture where designers were at the forefront of decision making, while engineers were the ones behind the scenes making it happen. We don't see that a lot these days. </h2>
