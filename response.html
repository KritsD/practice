                <h2 class="para">I really connected with Jacob Heftman's talk. One thing that really struck a chord with me was how <em>he took a beat after each question to gather his thoughts before giving such clear and concise answers.</em> It's so tempting to just jump in with an answer, but his approach of really understanding each question before responding really stood out to me.</h2>
